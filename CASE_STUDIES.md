# Capability Case Studies — Dataset Catalog

These are **Capability Case Studies**.

They document:
- What the Hollow House Institute dataset catalog enables
- How governance, access control, and licensing are structured
- Intended system behavior, not client outcomes

No client data, third-party results, or deployments are represented.
